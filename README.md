# Salix-AOM-control

This repository contains code for a Labview application for controlling the power of the 515 nm and 561 nm lasers in the C-Flex laser combiner (HÃ¼bner photonics) on _Salix_. These two lasers are Diode-Pumped Solid State (DPPS) lasers and should be run at maximum power for optimal performance. Their power can be modulated using acousto-optic modulators (AOM). There are two AOMs in the optical path of these two lasers (one for each laser), inside the C-Flex enclosure. By placing different voltagea over the AOMs, the transmission through the AOM can be set between (nearly) 0% up to 100%.

The Labview application lets the user set a _transmission percentage_ (labeled _Power (%)_ in the gui) for each laser using a slider. This percentage is converted to a voltage value (0-100% is linearly scaled to 0.5V-1.0V). These voltage values are written to the AO0 and AO1 channels (AO0 for 515 nm and AO1 for 561 nm) of a multi-function DAQ device (USB-6002, National Instruments). A lead from each channel (and AO ground) is terminated in a male BNC connector, to connect to the respective AOM controllers. The voltages (0.5V-1.0V DC) are taken from section _6.4 AOM Modulation controls and input signals_ on p.56-57 of the C-Flex owners manual (version DO579-C September 2020).

To use the application, download this repository and double-click on the file _'AOM control gui.exe'_. This will open the gui.

The source code of the application (inside the folder _source_) is structured as follows:
* _main.vi_ is the main vi
* the subfolder _source/subvis_ contains the subvi's:
    * _power_to_voltage.vi_: takes in a percentage (from the slider) and convert to a voltage
    * _set_power_to_max.vi_: writes the maximum voltage (1 V DC) to a given DAQ channel. This subvi is used at startup (in _main.vi_) of the application because the C-Flex manual states that "Always start with 1 V DC on the analog modulation input ...".
    * _set_power_to_zero.vi_: writes the minimum voltage (0.5 V DC) to a given DAQ channel. This is used in _main.vi_ when the shutter button in the gui is pressed.
* the files _AOM control gui.lproj_ (project file), _AOM control gui.lproj_  and _AOM control gui.lproj_ are (part of) the project used to build the executable

Any files that are generated when building the .exe file from the project are saved in the folder _builds/AOM control gui_:
* _AOM control gui.exe_: the executable. Double-click to run the application.
* _AOM control gui.aliases_ and _AOM control gui.ini_: files created during building of the .exe file
